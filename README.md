# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard 

## Project Description:
This interactive Power BI dashboard project presents a comprehensive analysis of emergency room (ER) data collected over a 19-month period. It is designed to help hospital administrators and healthcare professionals monitor patient flow, analyze demographics, track departmental referrals, and optimize operational efficiency in the emergency department.

## Tech Stack:
- Power BI – for interactive dashboard development and data visualization
- Microsoft Excel / CSV – used as the primary data source
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and custom KPIs
- Power Query – for data transformation and modeling
- Power BI Bookmarks and Filters – to enable monthly, consolidated, and detailed views

## Highlights:
Multiple View Modes:
- Monthly View: Zoom into specific months for granular insights.
- Consolidated View: Overall performance and usage trends.
- Patient Details: Row-level data visibility with demographic and wait time filters.
-	Key Takeaways: Executive summary of key metrics and trends.

Key Metrics Tracked:
- Total number of patients
- Average wait time
- Patient satisfaction score
- Admission vs. non-admission counts
- Department-wise referrals
- Race and gender distribution
- Peak hours and busy weekdays

Visual Elements:
- Bar and column charts, donut charts, heatmaps, and slicers
- Color-coded visuals for easy pattern recognition
- Hourly and daily traffic analysis using heatmaps

## Business Impact:
• Operational Optimization : The dashboard identifies peak busy hours (11AM, 7PM, 1PM, and 11PM) and busiest days (Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday), helping with optimal staff allocation and resource management.

• Strategic Decision-Making : With nearly equal numbers of admitted and non-admitted patients and a breakdown of referral departments, administrators can make informed decisions about departmental needs and triage processes.

• Improved Patient Experience : Though satisfaction scores are relatively high (4.99/5), the wait time (35.3 mins avg.)  indicates a need for process improvement to meet target response times (only 40.68% seen within 30 minutes).

• Diversity & Inclusion Insight : Demographic analysis shows broad racial representation and highlights potential equity concerns for future policy-making.
